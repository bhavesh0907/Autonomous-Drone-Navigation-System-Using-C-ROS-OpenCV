# Autonomous Drone Navigation System

This project implements an AI-driven autonomous drone navigation system using C++, ROS, and OpenCV. It enables real-time obstacle detection and path planning for safe drone flight.

## Features:
- Real-Time obstacle detection using computer vision.
- AI-based path planning for dynamic environments.
- Sensor integration for autonomous decision-making.

## Installation:
```bash
sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full
sudo apt install libopencv-dev
